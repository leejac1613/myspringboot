#### Sprint Retrospectives
**To change or not to change**
	**Good**: If we could redo the same sprint again, we would do these things in the same way
	**Could have done better**: If we could redo the same sprint again, we would do these things differently. 
	**Improvements**: Concrete ideas about how we could improve in the future.
#### SCRUM with XP (extreme programming)
Pair programming
TDD(Test-driven development)
	Test driven development means that you write an automated test, then you write just enough code to make that one test pass, then you refactor the code primarily to improve readability and remove duplication. Rinse and repeat.
Continuous Integration 
TDD Cycle 
	Write a test 
	Make it run
	Make it right
TDD means "Write one test, write code to pass that test, refactor, and repeat"
TDD Misconception
	"Write all the tests, then build a system that passes the tests"
	"Write some of the tests, then build a system that passes the tests"
	"Do lots of testing"
#### Evaluating Agile Processes
In Conclusion
	Agile processes appear to be a useful approach to building small-scale software products when the client's requirements are vague
	Also, some of the proven features of agile processes can be effectively utilized within the context of other life-cycle models

| Waterfall | Agile |
| ---- | ---- |
| Plan driven | Learning driven |
| Infrequent client communication | Continuous client communication |
| Requirements defined up front | Just-in-time requirements |
| Develop in distinct phases with interim paper deliverables | Develop and deliver working code in 2-week long iterations |
| View programming as construction | View programming as design |
| Integration of different layers occurs at end of build phase | Continuously integrate code throughout(hourly builds) |
| Testing as separate phase at end of project, typically emphasizing functional level | Fully-automated, continuous testing at both functional and unit level |
| High cost of change | Low cost of change |
